# Fuzzing101 with LibAFL - Part Three

Herein lies a solution to [Exercise 3 from Fuzzing101](https://github.com/antonio-morales/Fuzzing101/tree/main/Exercise%203) written in Rust, using [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL). 

The goal of the exercise is to find [CVE-2017-13028](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-13028/) in tcpdump 4.9.1.

The code housed here has a companion [blog post](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2021-11-20-fuzzing-101-with-libafl-part-3/) that delves into the different LibAFL components used in the solution.
