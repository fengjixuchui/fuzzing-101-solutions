# Fuzzing101 with LibAFL - Part Five

Herein lies a solution to [Exercise 5 from Fuzzing101](https://github.com/antonio-morales/Fuzzing101/tree/main/Exercise%205) written in Python (with Rust bindings), using [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL). 

The goal of the exercise is to find [CVE-2017-9048](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9048/) in version 2.9.4.

The code housed here has a companion [blog post](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2022-01-17-fuzzing-101-with-libafl-part-5/) that delves into the different LibAFL components used in the solution.
